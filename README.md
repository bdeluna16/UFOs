# UFOs

## Overview
In this challenege we were tasked with creating an HTML page to provide users a more viewable platform of data that they will use in their analysis of UFO sightings. To do this we built a table in the HTML page with data stored in a Javascript array. To make it fully dynamic we created multiple search filters that reacted to user inputs. 

## Results
With our new webpage users are now able to filter through the data with more specific search criteria. This can be extremely useful when for anyone wanting to do a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings.

 The below are examples of how users are able to utilize search filters in the webpage:

 1. Here are the different filters available to sort through the data

 2. The filters allows user to search for a single criteria or multiple at the same time

 ## Summary
 Overall our new webpage can make creating an analysis of UFO sightings easier/more efficient. However, one major drawback of this design is that if we were to add more data the size of the page would get larger and larger which could make loading/opening the page problematic. In order to solve this problem we could opt to not display all of the data on the page or display the data on another page.
